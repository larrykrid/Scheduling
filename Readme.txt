Driver - The driver class is where everything will be done for all 5 algorithms 
Process - The process class is for containing the informaiton about each process
that is created from process file.


How to compile and run
I was running it in an IDE, run configurations and have the first argument be the
processes file and then the second argument be the scheduling algorithm. 

Other notes
The only thing that I did not do was create a case for if the service_given was 
false. I could not figure out how to calculate the information. Everything else
should run properly.
